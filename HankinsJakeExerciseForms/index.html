                            Like Rainbow Dash, Fluttershy is originally from Cloudsdale. She was taller and ganglier than average in her youth and had slightly larger wings. In The Cutie Mark Chronicles, Fluttershy explains that she was a weak flier as a filly and faced harassment by bullies at flight camp. Rainbow defended her from the bullies at one point and challenged them to a race, though just after the contest started, the racers accidentally knocked Fluttershy off the clouds. Fluttershy ended up landing safely atop a large swarm of butterflies passing through a meadow. Having never been on the ground before, she marveled at the flora and fauna before the shockwave of a nearby explosion startled the animals into hiding. Fluttershy earned her cutie mark after comforting the animals and recognizing that she had an ability to communicate with them "on a different level".

                    Despite being a Pegasus, Fluttershy does not usually help with the weather and does not use her wings as much as the other winged ponies. As shown in Dragonshy, she is also scared of heights, which is ironic in that Pegasi live in the clouds most of their lives. Because of this, she instead focuses on tending to animals' care. In Party of One, Spike says, "Fluttershy [is] a Pegasus who's afraid of heights. Heh, what's up with that?"

                <h3>Shyness and Fear</h3>
                    <p>Fluttershy is generally depicted as shy and soft-spoken when interacting with other ponies in the first several seasons of the series. She responds with a nervous whisper when Twilight Sparkle asks her name during their first meeting in Friendship is Magic, part 1. In Griffon the Brush Off, Fluttershy is reduced to tears when Gilda berates her and roars in her face in response to an accidental collision. Before attending Iron Will's assertiveness seminar in Putting Your Hoof Down, Fluttershy avoids confrontation with other ponies at the market even when they take advantage of her.</p>

                    <div class="personality-content">
                <h3>Kindness and Empathy</h3>
                    <p>Fluttershy represents the element of kindness. When the rest of the Mane Six try to fight their way past a manticore in Friendship is Magic, part 2, Fluttershy stops them and shows compassion toward the creature; as a result, it reveals a thorn stuck in its paw as the reason for its aggression, and the ponies are able to proceed simply by removing the thorn. In Dragonshy, after shaming a dragon to the point of tears for attacking her friends and filling the sky with smoke, Fluttershy consoles it and assures that it's "not a bad dragon" but just "made a bad decision".</p>

                <h3>Assertiveness</h3>
                    <p>Despite her typically shy behavior, Fluttershy will occasionally assert herself and take initiative. In Sonic Rainboom, she rebuffs a group of bullies when they doubt Rainbow Dash's ability to perform a sonic rainboom in the Best Young Flyer competition. In It Ain't Easy Being Breezies, Fluttershy angrily insists that a group of bees leave Seabreeze alone after they ignore her calm appeals. In Fluttershy Leans In, Fluttershy pushes back on the views of her animal sanctuary's production team and insists on her vision for the project, leading Pinkie Pie to call her "Flutterbold".</p>

                <div class="personality-content">
                    <h3>Anger and Agression</h3>
                    <p>On rare occasions, Fluttershy acts aggressively towards others or loses her temper altogether. In The Best Night Ever, she grows frustrated when the animals of the Canterlot castle gardens avoid her and begins setting traps to catch them. When this fails, Fluttershy resorts to angrily shouting at the animals and ends up chasing them into the ballroom.</p>
